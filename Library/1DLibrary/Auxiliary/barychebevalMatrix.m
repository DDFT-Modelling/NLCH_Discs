function A = barychebevalMatrix(xIn,xOut)
% barychebevalMatrix(xIn,xOut) gives A that computes the values fOut taken 
% by a rational  interpolant with barycentric weights w, collocation points 
% xIn, and function values fIn at the points.
% 
% Inputs: xIn and xOut, the points at which the values are known, and those
% at which it is to be interpolated. Note that xIn must be in ascending
% order.
% Outputs: A, the matrix such that fOut \approx A*fIn.
